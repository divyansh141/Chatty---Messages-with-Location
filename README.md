# Chatty - Messages with Location

This is Chatty the messaging app.

## What does it do:
It is a messaging app in which you can sender's location from where he/she is sending you messages. You can also search other users who have registered on this app.

## What I have used:
I have used Firebase to store all chats and user's information.
To fetch current location used geolocator package and to convert current location's coordinates I used geocoder package. This package is very helpful to convert coordinates into addressLine or vice versa.
